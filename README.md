# Making Serverless Work For You

There's some code in here that I used for my talk "Making Serverless Work For You". The repository currently holds:

1. A `Common` project that holds a BlobStorageRepository
2. A `Functions` project that holds several Functions used in conjuction with Service Bus and Storage for processing and scaling
3. A `Frontend` folder that holds the Angular frontend you can also find running overe here: [MSWFY Frontend](https://mswfystorage.z6.web.core.windows.net/)

I'll keep the repo updated and I *will* add some more logic in the future.

Hope this helps ðŸ¤“
